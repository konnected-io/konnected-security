# Konnected Security

**Konnected Security** is a simple and inexpensive way to connect wired alarm system door/window sensors and motion
 sensors to [SmartThings](https://www.smartthings.com) for use with [Smart Home Monitor](https://support.smartthings.com/hc/en-us/articles/205380154-Smart-Home-Monitor)
 or any other SmartThings apps. Use Konnected Alarm Panel to convert your old wired alarm system into a SmartThings
 smart alarm. Or, if you're building/renovating a home, save money on wireless sensors and alarm system installation by 
 pre-wiring your home with sensors and connecting them to SmartThings with Konnected Alarm Panel.
 
 Konnected devices are based on open-source hardware and software. We [sell DIY kits](https://store.konnected.io) pre-loaded
  with Konnected software. Just follow the wiring instructions on this website. You can also build your own Konnected alarm panel
  with easily available components and the [Konnected Security open-source firmware](https://github.com/konnected-io/konnected-security).
